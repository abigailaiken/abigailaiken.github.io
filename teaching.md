### Fall 2014

### WWS 593B/POP 504B

In Fall 2014, I co-taught an advanced-level course for Master’s and doctoral students at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs entitled “Reproductive Health and Reproductive Rights”. The course was developed 15 years ago by Professor James Trussell and has been taught by him each year ever since. Classes were run as small-group discussion-based seminars, emphasizing the application of scientific principles and human rights frameworks to analyze reproductive health policy.
