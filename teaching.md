## Fall 2016

### PA 388K/WGS 393/SS 301: Reproductive Health and Reproductive Rights

This is a course for Master's students in the LBJ school and across
departments, including sociology, nursing, women's and gender studies,
social work, and education, as well as upper-division Plan II (liberal arts honors)
undergraduates at the University of Texas at
Austin. Classes are divided into three parts, including a
mini-lecture, discussion, and policy-oriented activites. Students
learn to apply scientific principles and reproductive rights
frameworks to such policy issues as unintended pregnancy,
contraceptive access, abortion in both the US and global contexts, and assisted reproduction. 

## Fall 2014

### WWS 593B/POP 504B: Reproductive Health and Reproductive Rights

I co-taught this advanced-level course for Masterâ€™s and doctoral
students at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International
Affairs with Professor James Trussell, who founded the course 15 years
ago. We ran classes as small group discussion-based seminars.
