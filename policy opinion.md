I believe that policies affecting reproductive health and reproductive
rights should be firmly based upon scientific evidence and the
principles of equity and autonomy. The following pieces are a mix of solicited and volunteered commentary on some recent policy and practice
issues.

### Contraception

* The 2014 endorsement of intrauterine devices and implants as "first line"
  contraceptives for teens by the American Academy of Pediatrics:
 [WWS Reacts: Are IUDs the Most Effective Form of Contraception for Teens?](http://wws.princeton.edu/news-and-events/news/item/wws-reacts-are-iuds-most-effective-form-contraception-teens)  

### Abortion

* In response to Ross Douthat's 2013 Op-ed "The Texas Abortion
  Experiment": [letter in The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/opinion/abortion-laws-in-texas-and-ireland.html?ref=todayspaper&_r=0)  
* The Fifth Circuit ruling on HB2, a Texas aborion bill signed into
  law in 2013: [WWS Reacts: Who is Most Affected by the Texas Abortion Law?](http://wws.princeton.edu/news-and-events/news/item/wws-reacts-who-most-affected-texas-abortion-law)
