I am a postdoctoral research associate at the <a
href="http://opr.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Office of Population
Research</a> at Princeton University. During the Fall 2014 semester, I
was also a lecturer at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and
International Affairs.  Prior to joining OPR, I completed my doctoral
work at the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/" target="_blank">LBJ School of Public Affairs</a> and Population Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin. 

My research interests are focused on reproductive health and span several disciplines, combining backgrounds in biomedical science, demography, public health, and public policy. My work has recently been published in the American Journal of Public Health, Social Science and Medicine, Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, Obstetrics and Gynecology, and American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, among others. My research has been supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Society of Family Planning.

I grew up in Northern Ireland and completed my bachelor's and medical
degrees at Trinity College, Cambridge. After moving to the U.S. in
2009 to attend the Harvard School of Public Health as a Frank Knox Fellow, I married a Texan, adopted some guinea pigs, and decided to stay awhile longer. In Fall 2016, I will join the faculty of the LBJ School at the University of Texas at Austin as assistant professor of public affairs.
