I believe that policies affecting reproductive health and reproductive
rights should be based on scientific evidence and the
principles of equity and autonomy. I am also committed to helping my
research findings reach a wider auidence beyond other academic
colleagues.

My and my collaborators' research has been reported by The BBC World Service, Reuters, The Associated Press, NPR, CNN, TIME Magazine, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, The Irish Times, Newsweek, The Chicago Tribune, The Dallas Morning News, The Houston Chronicle, NBC Universal, CBS, ABC News, and New Scientist, among others. 

The following pieces are a mix of solicited and volunteered commentary
on some recent policy and practice issues.
