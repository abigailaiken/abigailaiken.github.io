### My current research interests encompass three main areas: unintended pregnancy; reproductive health policy; and evidence-based obstetric practice 

###   Unintended Pregnancy 

Unintended pregnancy has long been a major public health and policy issue in the United States. Yet we are only just beginning to move away from the paradigm that women’s and men’s conceptualizations of pregnancy can, or should, be represented by static, one-dimensional constructs of plans or intentions. Using a mixed-methods approach, my work focuses on advancing the understanding of how women and men conceptualize pregnancy as a risk and potential reality. I explore intentions, feelings, and desires, and investigate their relationships with contraceptive behaviors and potential life impacts. The overarching goals of this research are to improve measurement of the burden of unintended pregnancy, characterize its relationships with adverse health outcomes, and inform policies aimed at prevention.

This article was selected for recommendation by the Faculty of 1000 as being of special significance in its field.

Significant disparities in rates of unintended pregnancy exist by race/ethnicity and by socioeconomic status. A further dimension of this work assessed the later-life health impacts of high parity among Latina women, including increased susceptibility to physical disability at older ages.

### Reproductive Health Policy 

This aspect of my research investigates international, national, and state policies affecting access to contraception, abortion, and reproductive health services. As part of the Texas Policy Evaluation Project (Tx-PEP), I have been engaged in projects describing how legislative budget reductions in public funding for family planning in Texas affect the ability of clinics to provide services and the ability of women to obtain their desired methods of contraception.

The postpartum period offers opportunities for women and providers to engage in shared contraceptive decision-making. Yet this key time is often overlooked in research aiming to improve access to contraception and reduce unintended pregnancy. In collaboration with domestic and international colleagues, I have examined system-level barriers affecting postpartum access to highly effective long-acting reversible methods of contraception via Medicaid in the U.S. and via the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK.

I am also interested in the development of new methods of contraception, improvements to existing methods, and ways to reduce financial barriers to methods with high upfront costs, as well as in reproductive health professionals' own experiences with contraceptive use and unprotected intercourse.

### Evidence-Based Obstetric Practice

Clinical guidelines and practice norms for managing prolonged labor due to fetal malposition vary widely by country. In the U.S, Cesarean section is the default mode of management. In the U.K, obstetric instruments including forceps and ventouse are available as alternatives to Cesarean section. In collaboration with clinical colleagues in the U.K., this aspect of my research compares maternal and neonatal outcomes for complex deliveries conducted using obstetric instruments versus Cesarean section and examines the factors influencing success. Findings support not only the safety of instrumental delivery, but also several benefits for maternal health over Cesarean delivery.

We are also interested in the development of training programs to help ensure that obstetric trainees receive adequate opportunities to develop skills in the use of obstetric instruments.
