### My current research interests encompass three main areas: unintended pregnancy; reproductive health policy; and evidence-based obstetric practice 

###   Unintended Pregnancy 

Unintended pregnancy has long been a major public health and policy issue in the United States. Yet we are only just beginning to move away from the paradigm that women’s and men’s conceptualizations of pregnancy can, or should, be represented by static, one-dimensional constructs of plans or intentions. Using a mixed-methods approach, my work focuses on advancing the understanding of how women and men conceptualize pregnancy as a risk and potential reality. I explore intentions, feelings, and desires, and investigate their relationships with contraceptive behaviors and potential life impacts. The overarching goals of this research are to improve measurement of the burden of unintended pregnancy, characterize its relationships with adverse health outcomes, and inform policies aimed at prevention.

Significant disparities in rates of unintended pregnancy exist by race/ethnicity and by socioeconomic status. A further dimension of this work assessed the later-life health impacts of high parity among Latina women, including increased susceptibility to physical disability at older ages.
